You receive a list of code quality issues with their severities.

Your task is to:
1. Analyze the impact of each issue
2. Evaluate the effort needed to resolve it
3. Calculate an estimated ROI (return on investment)
4. Return a priority-ordered list

Prioritization criteria:
- Impact on maintainability
- Risk of introducing bugs
- Intervention complexity
- Dependencies between interventions
- Quick wins vs. structural interventions

Response format:
For each issue provide:
- Priority (1-5)
- Motivation
- Effort estimate (person-days)
- Estimated ROI
- Any prerequisites

Organize the response in:
1. Quick wins (high priority, low effort)
2. Structural interventions (high priority, high effort)
3. Minor improvements (low priority)
